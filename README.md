# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

The assignment is to create a web application showing my porfolio, specifically including skills we have learned in the first 3 weeks of the bootcamp like flexbox, media queries and CSS variables. While an example was provided, the goal was to create a unique application. As you'll see from my deployed site, I have incorporated additional skills, such as: 

- javascript to hide/unhide header and navbar on scroll 
- javascript to showcase images via lightbox
- 3 flexbox sections with unique flexbox attributets that dynamically adjust sizes, columns
- box-shadows on hover to really make the selection pop
- significant layout changes at multiple media breakpoints
