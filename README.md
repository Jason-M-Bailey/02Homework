# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

The assignment is to create a web application showing my porfolio, specifically including skills we have learned in the first 3 weeks of the bootcamp like flexbox, media queries and CSS variables. While an example was provided, the goal was to create a unique application. As you'll see from my deployed site, I have incorporated additional skills, such as: 

- javascript to hide/unhide header and navbar on scroll 
- javascript to showcase images via lightbox
- 3 flexbox sections with unique flexbox attributets that dynamically adjust sizes, columns
- box-shadows on hover to really make the selection pop
- significant layout changes at multiple media breakpoints

## User Story

```

AS AN employer

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

```
